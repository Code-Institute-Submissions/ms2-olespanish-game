# Testing

## Code validators

[HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) : 

- Home Page
![Home Page HTML Validator](readme-files/val-home1.png)
The first test returned an error repeated 3 times. This was solved by removing the <button> element and adding a <div> instead. I also created .btn and .btn-link classes to fix the styling.
The same issue was found in the instructions.html and vocabulary.html files and was solved the same way.

[CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) : the test didn't find any errors.

## Responsiveness

To test the responsiveness of the site I used [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) and [Responsive Design Checker](https://www.responsivedesignchecker.com/).

Notes:

- The design is responsive in most screen sizes. The only issue that I've found is that on a 10'' Notebook screen the jumbotron on "Home Page" might overflow a small bit.

## Browser compatibility

Notes:

- On Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer, the call to action button on **Home Page** doesn't seem to show the background color, but thanks to the border that does display properly it's easy to still see that is a button.

## Testing User stories

- As an owner, I want to show off what we can do to attract more clients.
  - When the user is navigating the site, they'll see restaurant's images at the top of every page.
  - On the **Menu Page** the user can see all the dishes the restaurant offers with pricing information.
