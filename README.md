## 1. UX

#### 1.1. Project Goals

This game was designed for students of all ages learning the Spanish language (or just curious!). There are 3 levels that increase in difficulty:
- Beginners

In this level, every card provides 3 different pieces of information: a picture, a name and a pronunciation clip. 

- Intermediate

In this level, every card provides the same 3 different pieces of information, but adding 8 more cards (4 new words).

Both the Beginners and Intermediate levels are suitable for kids and people who can’t read, since they can match the cards by just looking at the pictures and/or listening to the voice clip.

- Advanced

In this level, the user has to match a card with an image with a card with the corresponding name and pronunciation. This would be the final test for students to prove what they know and to help them focus more on the actual word and try to memorize them while playing and having fun. 

This project’s main goals are:
- to learn new words
- to strengthen memory
- to have fun!

## 6. Credits

### 6.1. Content

I took inspiration from [Diogo Realles' CodePen](https://codepen.io/SoftwaRealles/pen/dExjRW) to style the header.

The neon effect buttons were created following [Coding Tuting](https://www.codingtuting.com/2019/09/neon-buttons-pure-css.html) and style to suit the project's needs.

The sound effects were implemented with help from [Button Sound Effects Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlwSz2dXK_8&ab_channel=AdamKhoury).
